Chaneka, Pak Chanek's child, is an ambitious kid, so Pak Chanek gives her the following problem to test her ambition.

Given an array of integers [A1,A2,A3,…,AN]. In one operation, Chaneka can choose one element, then increase or decrease the element's value by 1
. Chaneka can do that operation multiple times, even for different elements.

What is the minimum number of operations that must be done to make it such that A1×A2×A3×…×AN=0?

Input
The first line contains a single integer N (1≤N≤105).
The second line contains N integers A1,A2,A3,…,AN (−105≤Ai≤105).

Output
An integer representing the minimum number of operations that must be done to make it such that A1×A2×A3×…×AN=0.
